# Samadhan Portal

> A citizen-first issue reporting system — designed to make it simple for people to report local problems and for authorities to act fast.

I built **Samadhan Portal** to let the public report everyday civic problems in a structured, trackable way. Citizens can create issues with a photo, location, and short description; the system groups each submission into one of several categories and routes it to the responsible authority.

## 🧠 Problem We Solved

City residents often notice small but important problems — broken lights, potholes, clogged drains — but lack a simple, consistent way to report them. Reports that do arrive are frequently unstructured, missing location or photos, which makes resolution slow.

Samadhan Portal fixes that by giving users a guided form, enforcing required fields (location, category, photo), and routing issues to the right team.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User opens the portal (web or mobile).  
2. Chooses an issue **category** and, if applicable, a subcategory.  
3. Adds a short description, attaches a photo, and shares the location.  
4. The issue is accepted, assigned a tracking ID, and routed to the corresponding authority.  
5. Citizens can track status updates (Open → In Progress → Resolved) and receive notifications.

## 🗂️ Categories & Subcategories

### 1️⃣ Parks
- **Garden** — broken benches, overgrown hedges, damaged play equipment  
- **Electric** — park lighting not working  
- **Civil** — damaged pathways, fencing, signage  
> Anything tied to public parks and playgrounds.

### 2️⃣ Electric Pole
- **Not working** — streetlight or pole outages, flickering lights, exposed wiring  
> Focuses on pole & streetlight faults.

### 3️⃣ Road
- **Pothole** — potholes, surface damage, missing manhole covers  
> Road issues prioritize safety and rideability.

### 4️⃣ Sewerage
- **Chock** — clogged drains, overflowing gutters  
- **Maintenance** — broken covers, recurring backups  
> Handles drainage and sanitation problems.

### 5️⃣ Miscellaneous
- **Zone** — zoning-related issues or boundary problems  
- **Enforcement** — illegal encroachment, unauthorized construction  
> Catch-all for issues outside other categories.
